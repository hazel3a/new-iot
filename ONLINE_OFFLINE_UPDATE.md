# Online/Offline Status Update

## 🎯 **Changes Made**

The device management system has been updated to support only **ONLINE** and **OFFLINE** statuses, removing the previous "DELAYED" status. Additionally, devices now remain visible in the device list even when they disconnect.

---

## ✅ **Key Updates**

### **1. Device Status Simplification**

#### **Before:**
- 🟢 **ONLINE** - Device sent data in last 5 minutes
- 🟡 **DELAYED** - Device sent data in last 30 minutes
- ⚪ **OFFLINE** - No data for more than 30 minutes

#### **After:**
- 🟢 **ONLINE** - Device sent data in last 5 minutes
- ⚪ **OFFLINE** - No data for more than 5 minutes

### **2. Device Persistence**

#### **Before:**
- Devices could disappear from lists when they went offline
- Only "active" devices were consistently visible

#### **After:**
- ✅ **All devices remain in the list** even when offline
- ✅ **Offline devices show with gray "Offline" status**
- ✅ **Historical connection data is preserved**
- ✅ **Last known gas level and readings are maintained**

---

## 📋 **Updated Components**

### **1. Database Views (`updated_device_views.sql`)**

Updated the following views to use simplified ONLINE/OFFLINE logic:
- `active_devices` - Shows all non-blocked devices (online and offline)
- `device_history` - Complete device registry with current status
- `real_time_active_devices` - Enhanced view with real-time status
- `currently_active_devices` - Only devices that are currently online

**Key Logic Change:**
```sql
-- Old logic (3 statuses)
CASE 
  WHEN latest_reading >= NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes' THEN 'ONLINE'
  WHEN latest_reading >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 minutes' THEN 'DELAYED'
  ELSE 'OFFLINE'
END

-- New logic (2 statuses)
CASE 
  WHEN latest_reading >= NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes' THEN 'ONLINE'
  ELSE 'OFFLINE'
END
```

### **2. Flutter Models (`lib/models/device.dart`)**

Updated `ConnectionStatus` enum:
- ❌ Removed `delayed('DELAYED')`
- ✅ Kept `online('ONLINE')` and `offline('OFFLINE')`
- 🎨 Updated color schemes and icons to match

### **3. Flutter Screens**

#### **Devices Screen (`lib/screens/devices_screen.dart`)**
- ❌ Removed "Delayed" option from Status filter dropdown
- ✅ Status filter now shows: "All Status", "Online", "Offline"
- 🔄 Devices remain visible when they go offline

#### **Other Screens**
- All screens automatically inherit the updated logic
- Device cards show appropriate online/offline indicators
- Real-time updates continue to work seamlessly

## 🎨 **Visual Changes**

### **Status Indicators**

| Status | Color | Icon | Description |
|--------|-------|------|-------------|
| 🟢 **Online** | Green | `Icons.wifi` | Device actively sending data |
| ⚪ **Offline** | Gray | `Icons.signal_wifi_off` | Device not sending data |

### **Device Cards**

#### **Online Device:**
```
[🟢] Kitchen Gas Sensor          [Online]
ESP32_001
[ACTIVE] [SAFE (250)]
📊 1,245 readings  📅 89 today  🕐 2m ago
```

#### **Offline Device:**
```
[⚪] Living Room Sensor          [Offline]
ESP32_002  
[ACTIVE] [WARNING (450)]
📊 567 readings  📅 0 today  🕐 2h ago
```

## 📋 **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Update Database Views**
Run the SQL script in your Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Copy content from updated_device_views.sql and execute
```

### **2. Flutter App**
No additional setup needed! The app will automatically:
- ✅ Use the new simplified status logic
- ✅ Show all devices (online and offline)
- ✅ Update statuses in real-time

---

## 🔍 **Verification**

To verify the changes are working:

1. **Check Device List**: All previously connected devices should be visible
2. **Status Updates**: Devices should show "Online" when sending data, "Offline" when not
3. **Persistence**: Disconnect a device and verify it remains in the list as "Offline"
4. **Reconnection**: Reconnect the device and verify status changes to "Online"
