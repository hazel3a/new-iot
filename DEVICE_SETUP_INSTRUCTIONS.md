# Real-Time Device Detection Setup

## 🎯 Problem Solved
Your ESP32 device was sending gas sensor data but wasn't being automatically detected in the Active Devices screen. This setup creates automatic device registration whenever a device sends gas sensor readings.

## 📋 Setup Steps

### 1. Run the SQL Setup Script
1. Open your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy the entire content from `setup_real_time_devices.sql`
4. Paste it into the SQL Editor and **Run** it

### 2. Test the System
1. Make sure your ESP32 is running and sending gas sensor data
2. Open your Flutter app
3. Navigate to the menu (⋮) → **Active Devices**
4. You should now see your ESP32 device listed!

## ✅ What This Setup Does

### Automatic Device Registration
- ✅ Automatically detects when a device sends gas sensor data
- ✅ Registers the device in the device management system
- ✅ Updates connection status in real-time
- ✅ Tracks data counts and connection history

### Real-Time Features
- 🟢 **ONLINE**: Device sent data in last 5 minutes
- 🟡 **DELAYED**: Device sent data in last 30 minutes
- ⚪ **OFFLINE**: No data for more than 30 minutes

### Enhanced Information
- 📊 Total readings count
- 📅 Readings today count
- 🔥 Current gas level (SAFE/WARNING/DANGER/CRITICAL)
- 🕐 Last seen timestamp
- 📱 Device IP address
- ⚡ Real-time updates via database triggers

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Trigger**: When your ESP32 sends a gas sensor reading to `gas_sensor_readings` table
2. **Auto-Register**: A database trigger automatically:
   - Creates the device in `devices` table (if new)
   - Updates the last connection time
   - Logs the connection in `device_connections` table
   - Updates data counts
3. **Real-Time Views**: Enhanced database views show:
   - Connection status based on actual data timestamps
   - Current gas levels from latest readings
   - Statistics and history

## 📱 App Features

### Active Devices Screen
- Real-time device monitoring
- Device statistics dashboard
- Connection status indicators
- Current gas level display
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds

### Device History Screen
- Complete device registry
- Device management (Allow/Block/Delete)
- Search and filter capabilities
- Connection history tracking

## 🚀 Benefits

- **No Manual Registration**: Devices appear automatically when they send data
- **Real Accuracy**: Shows actual device status based on data timestamps
- **Real-Time Updates**: Live monitoring with database subscriptions
- **Complete History**: Track all device connections and activities
- **Easy Management**: Allow/block/delete devices with simple controls

## 🔍 Verification

To verify everything is working:

1. Check that your ESP32 is sending data to the `gas_sensor_readings` table
2. Go to Active Devices - you should see your device listed
3. The connection status should show as ONLINE if data was sent recently
4. The current gas level should display the latest reading
5. Total readings count should match your actual data

Your device management system is now fully automated and real-time! 🎉
