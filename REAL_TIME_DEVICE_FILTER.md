# Real-Time Device Filter Updates

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

The device filter dropdowns in the **Gas Readings** and **Alerts & History** screens were only loading devices once during initialization, causing a delay when new devices came online. Users had to manually refresh or restart the app to see newly connected devices in the filter dropdown.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

Updated both screens to have **real-time device filter updates** that immediately show new devices when they come online.

## 🚀 **Technical Implementation**

### **Real-Time Subscription Logic**
```dart
void _setupRealtimeSubscription() {
  _subscription = _supabaseService.subscribeToReadings(
    onInsert: (reading) {
      setState(() {
        _readings.insert(0, reading);
        // Update available devices immediately when new device appears
        if (!_availableDevices.contains(reading.deviceName)) {
          _availableDevices.add(reading.deviceName);
          _availableDevices.sort();
        }
      });
    },
    // ... handle updates
  );
}
```

### **Periodic Refresh System**
```dart
void _setupPeriodicRefresh() {
  // Refresh device list every 10 seconds for fast updates
  Timer.periodic(const Duration(seconds: 10), (timer) {
    _refreshDeviceList();
  });
}
```

### **Enhanced Device Dropdown**
```dart
DropdownButtonFormField<String?>(
  items: [
    const DropdownMenuItem(value: null, child: Text('All Devices')),
    ..._availableDevices.map((device) => DropdownMenuItem(
      value: device,
      child: Row(
        children: [
          Expanded(child: Text(device)),
          Icon(Icons.sensors, size: 16, color: Colors.green[600]),
        ],
      ),
    )),
  ],
)
```
